            <h2>About Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist
                    who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from
                    British rule.</li>
                <li>October 2nd is celebrated to honor him in the name of Gandhi Jayanti, as the entire country is
                    indebted to his efforts.</li>
                <li>His ideology of 'Ahimsa' meaning not to injure anyone was highly appreciated and was also followed
                    by many great personalities around the globe. He became the person who could not be defeated under
                    any circumstances. Mahatma Gandhi started the 'Khadi Movement' to push the use of fibers like khadi
                    or jute.</li>
                <li>His drive against 'untouchability' during his imprisonment in the Yerwada Jail, where he went on
                    fast against the age-old evil of untouchability in society, had greatly helped the community's
                    upliftment in the modern era.</li>
                <li>These qualities made him a man with a great soul and justified his journey from Gandhi to Mahatma.
                    He guided many freedom struggles and found the “Quit India Movement.”</li>
                <li>Mahatma Gandhi was the man who majorly contributed to the independence of India from British rule.
                    He spent his entire life serving his country and its people, and the international arena was the
                    face of Indian leadership. He was a man of ethics, values, and discipline who motivates and
                    encourages young people worldwide even today.</li>
                <li>As he showed through his own life, hard discipline can help in meeting any goal in life, as long as
                    we strive to stick to it and dedicate ourselves to it. These qualities made him a great leader who
                    is revered and respected even now, decades after his passing. And his fame and respect for his
                    ideologies still resonate not only in India but across the world as well.</li>
